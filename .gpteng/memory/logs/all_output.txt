================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

Request: バックアップなくとまった
。。バックアップなくとまった

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I understand that you want me to implement a backup system in Python. Here is a fully functional implementation of a backup system with the following features:

* A `Backup` class that takes a source directory and a target directory as input
* A `create_backup` method that creates a backup of the source directory in the target directory
* A `restore_backup` method that restores a backup from the target directory to the source directory
* A `list_backups` method that lists all available backups in the target directory
* A `delete_backup` method that deletes a specific backup from the target directory

Here is the implementation:

**requirements.txt**
```
dataclasses
```

**src/backup.py**
```
import os
import shutil
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime

@dataclass
class Backup:
    source_dir: str
    target_dir: str

    def create_backup(self):
        """Create a backup of the source directory in the target directory"""
        backup_dir = os.path.join(self.target_dir, f"backup_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}")
        os.makedirs(backup_dir, exist_ok=True)
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.source_dir):
            for file in files:
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                rel_path = os.path.relpath(file_path, self.source_dir)
                target_path = os.path.join(backup_dir, rel_path)
                os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(target_path), exist_ok=True)
                shutil.copy2(file_path, target_path)

    def list_backups(self):
        """List all available backups in the target directory"""
        backups = [f for f in os.listdir(self.target_dir) if f.startswith("backup_")]
        return backups

    def restore_backup(self, backup_name):
        """Restore a backup from the target directory to the source directory"""
        backup_dir = os.path.join(self.target_dir, backup_name)
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(backup_dir):
            for file in files:
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                rel_path = os.path.relpath(file_path, backup_dir)
                target_path = os.path.join(self.source_dir, rel_path)
                os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(target_path), exist_ok=True)
                shutil.copy2(file_path, target_path)

    def delete_backup(self, backup_name):
        """Delete a specific backup from the target directory"""
        backup_dir = os.path.join(self.target_dir, backup_name)
        shutil.rmtree(backup_dir)
```

**src/main.py**
```
from backup import Backup

def main():
    source_dir = "/path/to/source/directory"
    target_dir = "/path/to/target/directory"
    backup = Backup(source_dir, target_dir)

    # Create a backup
    backup.create_backup()

    # List all backups
    backups = backup.list_backups()
    print(backups)

    # Restore a backup
    backup_name = "backup_20230220150000"
    backup.restore_backup(backup_name)

    # Delete a backup
    backup.delete_backup(backup_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This concludes a fully working implementation of a backup system in Python.
